# Notes

## Todo
 - Get llil by index in function impl
 - Implement remaining instructions
 - Implement remaining expressions
 - Re-implement procedures, calling conventions, etc
 - Get strings at location
 - Get disassembly
 - Get disassembly for llil

## Ideas
 - Analyze the stack to identify strings, pointers, shellcode, function pointers
 - Static analysis of crypto circuts
 - Analyze program for information leaks, or for leaks of key data (like return of syscall that gets user password)
